# Project Instructions for AI
You are working on "Dispotraders Modern".
- FRAMEWORK: Next.js 14+ (App Router).
- STRICT RULE: Do NOT use `pages` router. Do NOT use `next.config.js` for i18n (it is unsupported).
- STYLING: Tailwind CSS.
- ANIMATION: Framer Motion.
- ROUTING: Use folder-based routing (e.g., `src/app/en/page.tsx`).

# Common Mistakes to AVOID:
1. Do not import `globals.css` anywhere except the ROOT layout.
2. Do not try to export metadata from Client Components ("use client").
3. Do not add `i18n` config to next.config.js.

# Workflow:
- Give me full file content when asking for changes so I can copy-paste.
- Fix TS errors immediately.
